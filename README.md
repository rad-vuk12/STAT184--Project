# STAT184--Project
My project delves into soccer statistics, specifically looking at answering questions of how much have average goals changed across decades, spanning from 1870s-preesent, as well as the importance of home games vs away/neutral. The conclusions drawn from the project were:
  1. On average, nowadays there are less goals per game when compared to late 1800s. There are significantly more games played nowadays which skews data.
  2.  Draw rate is a lot higher in 2020s when compared to previous century.
  3.  Whether a team plays at their home stadium vs away/neutral stadium has significant impact on the outcome of the game, as there are more home game wins in both friendlies and tournament games. I've added more context to this question by introducing simple Elo rating system which should tell us more on skill disparity between the teams and how that can affect outcome. I've found that the higher the rating gap, the higher the chance is of winning a home game is.

For my project I decided on using the BOAST Style Guide as it is helpful in writing clear object names, consistent spacing, and readable pipelines which is great for a beginner.
